Abstract
We provide an open access, high resolution and time synchronised dataset from multiple sensors worn at different body locations including Photoplethysmogram (PPG), Inertial, Pressure and ECG. The recordings are from 22 healthy subjects performing 3 physical activities. This dataset contains 66 waveform records from multi-site and multi-wavelength PPGs, sensors’ attachment pressures, sensors’ temperatures, inertial data from accelerometer and gyroscope, along with annotated ECG data for a total of 19 channels. Additionally, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, as well as blood oxygenation saturation levels (SpO2) numerics are provided.

Background
Pulse Transit Time (PTT) is the time that pulse waves require to travel in blood vessels between two sites [1]. It is an important indicator for many medical properties [2] and recent research focused on its potential for continuous blood pressure monitors [3, 4]. Three challenges make it difficult to measure PTT precisely: 1) Photoplethysmogram (PPG) measurements are inherently noisy [5, 6], 2) the required wave phase detection accuracy for measurement sited in proximity (e.g., on the same finger) is in the order of milliseconds [7] and 3) the lack of available datasets for PPG measurements in proximity at the required high sample rates. This dataset is designed to address these challenges by providing, amongst other physiologic time series and numerics such as blood pressure, 2x3 unfiltered raw PPG sensor signals of multiple wavelengths for 2 measurement sites in a defined distance to each other.

The dataset contains 66 recordings of 19 physiologic time series for more than 40000 heartbeats. These data were collected to conduct investigations into signal processing and machine learning models for applications in short distance Pulse Transit Time (PTT) recognition, cuffless pressure sensing and other cardiovascular activity modelling research.

Methods
The data were acquired from 22 healthy subjects at The University of Sydney. 6 participants were female and the age range was from 20 to 53 with a mean of 28.52 years. All participants performed 3 activities in random order, namely sitting, stationary walking and running. The data was collected from a device similar to commercial pulse oximeters, containing commercial sensors in a 3D-printed finger clip. A 3-lead ECG recorded the electrical signal of the heart in parallel. The included file device_schematic.png illustrates the used device.

The numerical records include gender, age group, weight group, systolic and diastolic blood pressure at the beginning and end of each activity. The heart rate was recorded at the beginning and end of the measurements with a commercial pulse oximeter and blood pressure monitor. SpO2 levels were measured at the start and end of each activity.

The hardware consisted of the following sensors, their locations is illustrated in the attached file device_schematic.png:

1x AD8232 ECG amplifier ecg measuring at 500Hz
All sensors were connected to an ARM Cortex-M4 at 180 MHz microcontroller, reading all sensors within a 2ms window (500Hz).

The blood pressure was recorded with an OMRON HEM-7322 blood pressure monitor and blood oxygen saturation levels with an iHealth Air Wireless Pulse Oximeter.

The study was approved by the University of Sydney's Human Research Ethics Committee (approval 2020/7059) and all participants gave written informed consent.

Data Description
The data is distributed in two formats, WFDB (WaveForm DataBase) and CSV (comma-separated-value). The WFDB data for all participants have been placed in the root directory along with a corresponding RECORDS file. Each WFDB .hea header file contains the participants' numerics such as <weight>. .atr annotation files contain automatically detected and manually verified R peak ECG annotations for all records. Record, header and annotation file names incorporated subject and activity following this structure:

sXX_YYYY

s = subject
XX = subject number (1-22)
YYY = activity (sit, walk, run)
The data is also provided in CSV format in the \CSV folder. All CSV records include a “time” column that was date shifted to de-indentify participants. The \CSV folder also contains the file subjects_info.csv, describing the participants' numerics such as <weight>.
