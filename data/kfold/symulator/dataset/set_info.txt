Sampling: 500Hz
Number of RR intervals: 500

Setting 1: Low Arrhythmia Presence
Median length of arrhythmia episode: 3
Arrhythmia burden: 0.1
Rate of atrial premature beats: 0.05
Description: These settings simulate a situation where arrhythmia is rarely present, and episodes are short. This can represent patients with mild symptoms.

Setting 2: Moderate Arrhythmia with a Moderate Number of Premature Atrial Beats
Median length of arrhythmia episode: 10
Arrhythmia burden: 0.3
Rate of atrial premature beats: 0.15
Description: Simulates patients with moderate arrhythmia, where arrhythmia occurs more frequently with a higher number of premature atrial beats.

Setting 3: High Arrhythmia Presence with Short Episodes
Median length of arrhythmia episode: 5
Arrhythmia burden: 0.5
Rate of atrial premature beats: 0.1
Description: Simulates patients with frequent but short-lived arrhythmia. These signals help in detecting arrhythmia that often disrupts the normal heart rhythm.

Setting 4: Long Episodes of Arrhythmia
Median length of arrhythmia episode: 30
Arrhythmia burden: 0.4
Rate of atrial premature beats: 0.2
Description: These settings generate signals with long arrhythmia episodes, which can be particularly relevant for patients with more severe rhythm disturbances.

Setting 5: Continuous Arrhythmia with a High Number of Premature Beats
Median length of arrhythmia episode: 50
Arrhythmia burden: 0.9
Rate of atrial premature beats: 0.4
Description: A very advanced scenario where arrhythmia is almost continuous, and a large number of beats are premature. This setting trains the classifier on extreme cases of arrhythmia.
